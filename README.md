# Task 1:

For executing the testing (while being inside the "Testing" folder) execute:

- node ./script.js

For executing the backend (while being inside the "backend-HP" folder) execute:

- npm run serve

For executing the frontend (while being inside the "frontend-hp" folder) execute:

- npm run dev

Problems with the app:

- When filtering albums as a user, the app only works with the start of the string.
  - Ej 1: When searching "old" for finding all the "Old Town Road" versions, by Lil Nas X, the app filters all the answers correctly.
  - Ej 2: When searching "town" for finding all the "Old Town Road" versions, by Lil Nas X, the app doesn't filter all the answers correctly.

# Task 2:

Changes done in the second task:

- Using "-then" instead of ".end" (maybe the next programmer isn't fammiliar with ".end" in express.js)
- using Try and Catch for error handling.
- Changing anonymous functions for anonymous arrow functions.
- Guardar algunos valores que se repiten mucho y son muy largos.
- Storing some values that are repeated various times.
- Desestructuration.

### Thoughts after doing the app.

Before doing this app I wasn't familiar with VueJs as my main framework was ReactJS. After doing all the tasks I believe I have improved a little bit in express.js too.
